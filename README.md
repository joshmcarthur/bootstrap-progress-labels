=========================

Add scaled numeric labels to Twitter Bootstrap progress bar components:

Usage:
---

Simply install bootstrap.progress-bar-labels.js in your application with a script tag (after loading Twitter Bootstrap javascripts):

``` html 
	<script src="bootstrap.progress-bar-labels.js"></script>
```

And then start adding labels to your progress bars, by adding the following attributes:

* **class**: `"progress progress-labelled"` (using progress-labelled means that labels are automatically added to the progress bar)
* **data-label-max**: The upper bound of the scale - e.g. 100. Must be present, and be a number.
* **data-label-scale**: The number to increment for each label - e.g. 10. Must be present, and be a number.

This plugin is written using [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org). Please **do not change the Javascript files, as they are automatically generated**. Instead, change the .coffee files in the 'coffee' directory, and compile them to Javascript. Personally, I use the following command:

``` bash
coffee -cwo . coffee
```

Each time you change the plugin, be sure to open the Jasmine unit tests (`open spec/SpecRunner.html`), and make sure everything still passes.
